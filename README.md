# Personal Portfolio Project at CODSOFT

## Project Overview

Creating a personal portfolio using CSS and HTML is a popular beginner web development project. This project will guide you through building a professional portfolio to showcase your skills, experience, and projects. The portfolio is a great way to make a strong first impression and present your work in an organized and visually appealing manner.

This project focuses on the following key sections:
- **Header Section**: Add your name or a logo at the top. Optionally, include a brief introduction or tagline to quickly convey who you are.
- **About Section**: Insert an image of yourself and write a short bio highlighting your skills and experience.
- **Skills Section**: List your key skills or areas of expertise, providing a clear view of what you excel at.
- **Projects Section**: Showcase samples of your work or projects, including project titles, descriptions, and images.
- **Resume Section**: Provide a link to download your resume in PDF format, making it easy for potential employers to learn more about your qualifications.
- **Contact Section**: Include your contact information, such as an email address and phone number, ensuring you're accessible to anyone interested in your work.
- **Footer**: Add a copyright notice and any additional links or information, such as social media profiles.
